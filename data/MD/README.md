### MD Data
In an effort to present the MD data in a sensible fashion, directories exist for each "experiment", with topology files and data.

GitHub *hates* big files, so please email me (Grayson/Kivean) for untruncated trajectories.  In the future, we will develop a repository for huge datasets, but so far our insstitution hasn't been terribly helpful in thsi regard.  Please email me if you have a better solution!
